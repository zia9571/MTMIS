# MTMIS
A Movie Theater Management Information System (MTMIS) is designed to streamline and enhance the operations of a movie theater. The system provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing ticket sales, tracking movie schedules, and offering a seamless experience to both customers and theater staff. 
Here is the entire documentation of the project, inlcuding the DFD, ER-Diagrams, Use-Case diagrams, Class and Object diagram as well as the screenshots and codes of the system.
